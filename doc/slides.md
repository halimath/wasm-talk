# What is WebAssembly

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

---

# What is WebAssembly? (cont.)

* Stack-based virtual machine (similar to the JVM or the CIL of .NET)
    * Non object-oriented (only supports simple datatypes)
    * Linear memory - memory is just an `ArrayBuffer` (no GC)
* Compilation target of compiled programming languages
* Sandboxed execution environment
    * Host interaction via imports/exports
    * security checks applied
* W3C standard (1.0)

---

# How to run?

* Built-in browser support: https://caniuse.com/?search=wasm
![width:auto](./caniuse.png)

* Built-in _node.js_ support
* Dedicated / stand-alone interpreters (see later)

---

# Which languages can compile to WASM?

* C/C++ `emscripten`
* Rust _built-in_
* Go _built-in_, `TinyGo`
* C# `Blazor`, `Uno` / F# _community_
* Kotlin _built-in_
* AssemblyScript _native_
* Dart/Flutter _built-in_
* Swift _community_
* Zig _built-in_
* Nim (via generated C-Code)
* ...

--- 

# Why WASM?

* Performance
* Re-use existing (C/C++) code bases
* Hide implementation details (better then JS obfuscation)

---

# Use Case #1: Web Apps

* Re-use existing code bases in browser apps
* Use WASM to provide calculation intense parts of an app
    * signal processing (images, video, audio)
    * Complex calculations (i.e. graphics, 3d models)
    * Weather simulation
    * Games (of course ðŸ˜€)    
* In use today:
    * Jupyter Notebooks (running full Python interpreter on WASM incl. numpy, ...)
    * Photoshop/Lightroom browser apps (Adobe)
    * Figma
    * TinkerCAD
    * ...

---

# Downsides (Web Apps)

* No built-in API for DOM manipulations
    * Needs JS interaction hooks (slow)
    * Will be refined in upcomining standards draft
* "Fat" binaries
    * No GC built-in -- languages need to ship a custom GC as part of the module
    * No standard lib - languages need to package everything they need

WebAssembly 2.0 (draf) will address some of these with
* reference types
* optional GC to be used to cleanup WebAssembly memory

# 3-tier web app architecture

![3-tier web app architecture](./3-tier-arch.png)

--- 

# WASI - WebAssembly System Interface

* Own spec building on WebAssembly specs
* Same VM/assembly code
* Specs for types/functions that interact with the underlying OS
    * Filesystem
    * I/O streams
* Very early draft (current spec is named "preview1", "preview2" is in dev)

--- 

# Use Case #2: Backend Apps/Serverless/FaaS

* Write portable backend apps/functions targetting WASM/WASI
    * Use any language that can compile to WASM/WASI
* Different VM implementations: wasmtime, WAMR, WasmEdge, wazero, Wasmer, wasmi, wasm3
* Kubernetes devs work on providing k8s for WASM (instead of Containers): FaaS

---

# Downsides (Backend Apps)

* WASI specs early drafts
* Lots of features missing (i.e. direct network access)
* Area of active development

---

# How does a virtual stack machine work

* operands are pushed onto a stack
* Operations pop operands off the stack and push the result back onto the stack
* Function arguments and return values are also passed via the stack

---

# How does a virtual stack machine work (cont.)

`2 + 3`

```lisp
i32.const 2
i32.const 3
i32.add
```

---

# How does a virtual stack machine work (cont.)

`2 + 3`

```lisp
i32.const 2
i32.const 3
i32.add
```

... or equivalent as _S-expressions_

```lisp
(i32.add
    (i32.const 2)
    (i32.const 3)
)
```

# How does it look like?

```lisp
(module
    ;; Define a function fib to calculate the n-th fibonacci number in a resource wasting way.
    (func $fib (export "fib") (param i64) (result i64)
        ;; Calculate param < 3
        (i64.lt_u
            (local.get 0)
            (i64.const 3)
        )
        
        ;; If result of comparison is true (!= 0)...
        (if (result i64)
            (then 
                ;; ... then put 1 on the stack ...
                i64.const 1
            )
            (else
                ;; ... otherwise compute fib(param - 1) + fib(param - 2)
                ;; and leave the result on the stack
                (i64.add
                    (call $fib
                        (i64.sub 
                            (local.get 0)
                            (i64.const 1)
                        )
                    )

                    (call $fib
                        (i64.sub 
                            (local.get 0)
                            (i64.const 2)

# Hello, WASI

            (i32.const 20) ;; nwritten - A place in memory to store the number of bytes written
        )
        drop ;; Discard the number of bytes written from the top of the stack

# How fast is WASM?

Very simple CPU-intensive benchmark:

```js
// Javascript
function fib (x) {
    if (x === 0) return 0;
    if (x < 2) return 1;
    return fib(x-1) + fib(x-2);
}
```

```c
// C
unsigned long long fib(const unsigned long long x) {
    if (x == 0) return 0;    
    if (x < 3) return 1;
    return fib(x-1) + fib(x - 2);
}
```
